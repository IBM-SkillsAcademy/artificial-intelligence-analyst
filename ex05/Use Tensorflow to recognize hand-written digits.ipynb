    "    - In the COS instance, click the **Endpoints** tab.\n",
    "    - Under **Select resiliency**, select **Cross Region**.\n",
    "    - Under **Select location**, select the location of your Watson Studio service instance (e.g. `eu-geo`).\n",
    "    - Copy the first endpoint under the **Public** column (e.g. `s3.eu.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`). This value will be appended to `https://` and used in the `service_endpoint` variable, in the third code cell.\n",
