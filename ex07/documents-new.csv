Technology - brighthand.com,"Thanks to an apparent slip-up, Microsoft has given the world a look at its upcoming online synchronization service for Windows Mobile called My Phone. The web site for this service is live now, but not fully functional. Still, there's enough to give a complete overview of what it will offer.For years, business users have been able to backup their address book and calendar data with a remote server thanks to Exchange ActiveSync. Consumers, on the other hand, haven't been able to do this without paying for an additional service. My Phone will change this.However, this upcoming service won't offer all the features of Exchange ActiveSync. It will only synchronize calendar and contacts, not email. However, it will allow users to synchronize photos and other files, not something offered by the business software.In addition, My Phone users will be able to go to a web site and access their personal information. They will be able to make changes and these will be reflected on their smartphone the next time they synchronize. In another difference from Exchange ActiveSync, changes won't sync immediately, but only once per day.As Microsoft's own words:Microsoft My Phone syncs information on your mobile phone to a storage space on a web site hosted by Microsoft. If your phone is lost or stolen, or if you upgrade to a new phone, you can easily restore the contacts, calendar appointments, photos, and other information that you stored on My Phone to a compatible new or replacement phone.Microsoft My Phone enables you to view and manage phone information by using a web browser. In your web account, you can add, edit, and delete contacts and calendar appointments, and the changes will appear on your phone the next time that you sync.The service is going to be free, and will be compatible with most devices running Windows Mobile 6+.This is apparently a confirmation of the earlier rumors about 'Skybox', as the URL for My Phone is getskybox.com.According to unconfirmed reports, the official announcement of this service will be at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) tradeshow later this month.Microsoft My Phone vs. Apple MobileMeMy Phone immediately draws comparisons with Apple's MobileMe service, as both offer over-the-air data synchronization to consumers, and all the data to be accessed via a web portal.This is a 'back to the future' comparison, as when MobileMe was launched it was compared to Exchange ActiveSync. The MobileMe service might actually be a slightly closer to Microsoft's sync service for businesses, though, as it allows users synchronize their emails, too.Additional DetailsAs mentioned earlier, this is not a 'push' service. Instead, My Phone will automatically synchronize information between the smartphone and the online account once a day between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am.  However, user will be able to manually initiate a sync whenever they choose.This upcoming service will apparently allow users to synchronize the contents of the My Documents folder on their smartphone with their online account. Microsoft will provide 200 MB of free storage for this. It's not clear at this point if this will include files stored on a removable memory card.The web site for My Phone also reveals how this service will inter-operate with other synchronization services. When the user has an active connection with Microsoft Exchange server, My Phone will not synchronize contacts, calendar appointments, or tasks. Windows Live contacts will only be synced with the Windows Live web site, not My Phone."

Technology - computerworld.com,"February 3, 2009 (Computerworld) The U.S. government has hired IBM to build a supercomputer with more power than all the supercomputers on the Top500 supercomputer list combined. It's an ambitious claim by IBM in a business where jumbo-size claims are the norm. The planned Sequoia system, capable of 20 petaflops, will be used by the U.S. Department of Energy in its nuclear stockpile research. The fastest systems today can only reach 1 petaflop, a remarkable achievement in its own right that was met only last year. It 'is the biggest leap of computing capability ever delivered to the lab,' said Mark Seager, assistant department head for advanced technology at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., where the system will be housed. It's expected to be up and running in 2012. IBM is actually building two supercomputers under this contract. The first one, to be delivered by midyear, is called Dawn and will operate at around 500 teraflops. Researchers will use Dawn to help prepare for the larger system. Sequoia will use approximately 1.6 million processing cores, all IBM Power chips, running Linux, which dominates high-performance computing at this scale. IBM is still developing a 45-nanometer chip for the system and may produce something with eight or 16 cores -- or more -- for it. Although the final chip configuration has yet to be determined, the system will have 1.6TB of memory and be housed in 96 'refrigerator-size' racks. The cost of the system wasn't disclosed. The supercomputer is also helping to drive a massive power upgrade at Lawrence Livermore, which is increasing the amount of electricity available for all its computing systems from 12.5 megawatts to 30 megawatts. To achieve the upgrade, it will run more power lines to its facility. Sequoia alone is expected to use about 6 megawatts, according to Seager. The world's first computer to break the teraflop barrier was built at Sandia National Laboratories in 1996. A teraflop equals a trillion floating points a second; a petaflop is 1,000 trillion (one quadrillion) sustained floating-point operations per second. It takes government funding to build systems of this scale and size, but that also means that the U.S. is paying for much of the problem-solving it takes to scale across more than a million cores. 'This is what's so good about it,' said Herb Schultz, manager of deep computing at IBM. 'They [the national lab] end up proving that you can get codes to scale that high.' In effect, by solving those problems, the national lab's work will pave the way for broader adoption of massive systems that could improve weather research, forecasts, tornado tracking, and work on a variety of other research problems. Large systems such as Sequoia help researchers reduce uncertainty and improve precision in simulations that can, for instance, predict tornado paths. The more compute power available, the more fine tuned and accurate the simulation. The major problem in running a system of this scale is 'the applications -- porting the applications and scaling them up is a critical problem we are facing,' said Seager. There are two petaflop systems in the U.S., IBM's Roadrunner at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which passed the petaflop barrier last May, and Cray Inc.'s XT Jaguar at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. IBM plans to build Sequoia at its Rochester, Minn., plant."
Technology - computerworlds.com,"January 29, 2009 (Computerworld) Want to know if you're actually getting what you're paying your ISP for?If you are, join the club. The problem is that it it's been far from easy to get a handle on how your ISP deals with various kinds of traffic. That may become an easier job now that Google Inc. is launching what it calls Measurement Lab (M-Lab), an open platform that researchers and consumers can use to access its new Internet performance measurement tools.'Researchers are already developing tools that allow users to, among other things, measure the speed of their connection, run diagnostics, and attempt to discern if their ISP is blocking or throttling particular applications,' said Vint Cerf, Google's chief Internet evangelist, and Stephen Stuart, Google's principal engineer, in a blog post. 'These tools generate and send some data back-and-forth between the user's computer and a server elsewhere on the Internet. Unfortunately, researchers lack widely-distributed servers with ample connectivity. This poses a barrier to the accuracy and scalability of these tools.'To tackle the problem, Google announced late Wednesday that it will host the tools on 37 servers in the U.S. and Europe. The tools are designed to help users try to figure out what might be impairing their broadband speed, as well as find out if BitTorrent is being blocked or throttled by their ISPs.'Seems like the intention behind this is to give consumers a way to keep tabs on their provider and make sure that they're getting what they're paying for in terms of speed,' said Dan Olds, principal analyst with the Gabriel Consulting Group. 'Also, with these tools, consumers will supposedly be able to tell if particular high bandwidth applications, like BitTorrent, are being constrained by their ISP. So if an ISP is limiting video downloads, for example, consumers can use the Google tool, figure it out, and start a huge outcry, putting pressure on the ISP to stop.'Just last month, an analyst with ties to the telecom industry released a report calling Google a bandwidth hog. Scott Cleland, president of Precursor LLC, a research firm bankrolled by telecom heavyweights like AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., reported that Google uses 21 times more bandwidth than it pays for. Google was quick to fire back. Richard Whitt, Google's Washington telecom and media counsel, noted in a blog post that Cleland is 'not exactly a neutral party.' Whitt also claimed that the analyst had made methodological and factual errors.Olds noted that the new measurement platform is another salvo in the war between content providers, like Google, and network providers."

Technology - foxnews.com,"LAS VEGAS '  Microsoft Corp.'s next version of the Windows operating system is almost ready for prime time. That's one message Chief Executive Steve Ballmer delivered on the eve of the official opening of the International Consumer Electronics Show.The world's largest software maker also disclosed deals to make its Live Search programs the default search engines on more personal computers and mobile phones.And it announced a new version of its Ford Sync in-car technology that folds in the voice-operated directory service TellMe, which Microsoft bought in 2007.For years, the opening keynote at CES belonged to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, whose status as industry pioneer justified the sweeping visions of the future he'd build into his speech.Gates passed the mantle on when he stepped down from day-to-day operations at Microsoft last summer, and Wednesday marked Ballmer's first time making the high-profile address.'It feels like we've entered a period of reduced expectations, a time when we may be tempted to temper our optimism and scale back our ambitions,' Ballmer said, in a nod to the recession. 'But no matter what happens with the economy or how long this recession lasts, I believe our digital lives will only continue to get richer.'Ballmer said Microsoft would continue to invest more in research and development than its technology peers.The CEO announced that a nearly final 'beta' test version of Windows 7 will be available Friday for regular PC users to download and tinker with.The new operating system which could be available for purchase on PCs within a year uses much of the same underlying technology as its predecessor, the much-maligned Vista.But Windows 7 aims to resolve many problems PC users had with Vista. For instance, Microsoft pledges to make it easier to install peripheral devices and to have the software pump out fewer annoying warnings and notifications.Ballmer also "

Technology - informationweek.com,"Several mobile operators and manufacturers have banded together to create a standard for a universal charger for mobile phones with an implementation target date of 2012. Announced this week by the GSMA, which is coordinating the effort, the 17 participants will use Micro-USB as the common universal charging interface. The GSMA said the participants have agreed that all new available mobile phone models have support for a universal charging connector. 'The mobile industry has a pivotal role to play in tackling environmental issues and this program is an important step that could lead to huge savings in resources, not to mention convenience for consumers,' said Rob Conway, GSMA chairman, in a statement. 'There is enormous potential in mobile to help people live and work in an eco-friendly way.' Conway noted that a universal charger would enable a consumer to use the same charger for future handsets. In addition, consumers would be able to charge their handsets from any available charger and the fact that 50% fewer chargers would be manufactured each year would help reduce greenhouse gases. The initial members of the GSMA's UCS effort include 3 Group, AT&T (NYSE: T), KTF, LG, Mobilkom Austria, Motorola (NYSE: MOT), Nokia (NYSE: NOK), Orange, Qualcomm (NSDQ: QCOM), Samsung, Sony (NYSE: SNE) Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, Telenor, Telstra, T-mobile and Vodafone (NYSE: VOD)."
